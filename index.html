      I wanna stay<br>
      Ain't gonna lie (Woo)<br>
      It don't get better than your big brown eyes, oh<br>
      I think I broke (What'd ya break?)<br>
      My brain, so I go<br>
      Off<br>
      <br>
      Feeling I think I'll get in the car<br>
      Gotta get out of my head, but I'm looking at who you are<br>
      Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie<br>
      I lie to myself<br>
      I don't want no one else<br>
      All along (Oh)<br>
      Yeah, I was wrong<br>

      (Darling, can you ride?<br>
      Let me know)<br>
      Bright brown through green deep blue<br>
      Every lover had a different hue<br>
      Even you with your hazel eyes<br>
      (Darling, came back home<br>
      I have to go)<br>
      Got your hair french braided<br>
      And your head in the skies<br>
      Such a heavenly mind<br>
      We should lay in grass<br>
      By the lake under trees<br>
      With the sun on your face<br>
      And the birds in the breeze<br>
      (Darling, can you ride anymore?)<br>
      Girl I like you a lot<br>
      Do you care?<br>
      Don't you see?<br>
      What the fuck am I saying?<br>
      This is overwhelming for you I know<br>
      But I really like you a lot<br>
      Uhm, sorry<br>
      Yeah<br>
      (Darling, be back soon<br>
      I have to go)<br>
